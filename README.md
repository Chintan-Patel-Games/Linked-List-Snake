# 🐍 Linked List Snake

**Linked-List-Snake** is a 2D Unity-based twist on the classic Snake game that integrates core computer science concepts. This project showcases the practical use of **Singly Linked Lists** and **Doubly Linked Lists** within gameplay mechanics.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

- Built with **Unity 2D**
- Classic snake movement and growth
- Different food types trigger unique linked list operations
- Game over on self-collision

## 🧠 Data Structures in Action

This project uses:

- The snake body is managed using a **Singly Linked List** or a **Doubly Linked List**, based on the selected branch, with food items triggering corresponding operations.
- **Food-triggered behaviors**:
  - 🍔 Burger - Insert at head
  - 🧀 Cheese - Insert in middle
  - 🍕 Pizza - Insert at tail
  - 🍎 Apple - Delete at head
  - 🥭 Mango - Delete at middle
  - 🍊 Orange - Delete at tail
  - ☠️ Poison - Delete half nodes
  - 🍷 Alcohol - Reverse Direction

Each food item maps to a specific **linked list operation**, turning gameplay into a fun data structure demo.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Unity Engine (2D)**
- **C#**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Linked List data structure implementation

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository:
